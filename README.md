# HTTP-Push
Home automation extension for Classic Pebble and Pebble Time (Aplite, Basalt, and Chalk support). Customize HTTP Request on your phone and trigger the call from your Pebble Watch.

A customizable HTTP request WatchApp perfect for Home Automation. The configuration page allows you to test requests before publishing to your Pebble.
 
Configure any number of HTTP GET/POST requests on your phone and fire them off on your watch. Setup JSON data for POST calls on the phone. Use the configuration page on your phone to create, delete, reorder and test individual HTTP request.
 
The Pebble interface provides feedback of each call attempt with HTTP status codes (200, 401, 404, etc). Requests are sent asynchronously, so you don't have to wait for a response before firing off another call. Setting the volume on your audio device has never been easier.
 
Save time by testing your requests on the configuration page before making it available to your Pebble. Also if you are sending JSON data, test the formatting right on the phone app.
